OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

  project: weather forecast application .

OBJECTIVE:
        The objective of a weather app contains a user input field for the user, which takes the input of the city name. Once the user enters the city name and clicks on the button, then the API Request is been sent to the OpenWeatherMap and the response is been retrieved in the application which consists of weather, wind speed, description, et.
        
         
Technology Used:        
                Here we are developing a Weather application using HTML, CSS for the frontend, and JavaScript             backend involves a structured methodology. We are using OpenWeatherMap’s API for the weather details


Data Flow Diagram of Weather Forecasting Project :  
                                                 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) serves as a visual representation of the flow of information within the system. This diagram illustrates how data, such as weather information, user details, and API Transactions in Weather Application.


KEY INSIGHTS: 
            
1. Reliability: The accuracy of weather information heavily depends on the reliability of the data source. If the application relies on a single source, discrepancies or inaccuracies in that source can impact the reliability of the weather data.

2. Dependency on External API’s: If the application relies on third-party APIs for weather data, it’s subject to the availability and performance of those APIs. Downtime or changes to the external service can affect the functionality of the application.

3. City Coverage: The availability and accuracy of weather data may vary for different cities. Some locations may have more comprehensive and accurate data than others, potentially leading to incomplete or less reliable information for certain areas.

4. Device and Network Dependency: The user experience can be affected by the device’s capabilities and network conditions. Slow internet connections or outdated devices may impact the responsiveness of the application.
